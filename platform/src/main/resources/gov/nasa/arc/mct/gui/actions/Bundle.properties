#Remove Manifestation
RemoveManifestation = Remove Manifestation
RemoveLastManifestationWarningTitle = Remove Last Manifestation
RemoveLastManifestationWarningText = Delete Object Core?\nThis is the last \
			manifestation of 

RemoveLastManifestationWarningText2 = visible to anyone \nanywhere, so removing \
			this manifestation will remove this\nobject's core, not just \
			remove this one manifestation.
RemoveLastManifestationHasDescendantsErrorText = Cannot remove this manifestation. \
			\nThis is the last manifestation of this object, so removing it \
			\nwill delete its core and possibly the cores of it descendants. \
			\nFor safety, you may remove this last manifestation only if  it \
			\nhas no descendants.  You must either empty this object, or drag \
			\nthis object elsewhere so this is not its last manifestation.			

			
#Delete Object Action
DeleteWarningTitle = Delete
DeleteWarningText = Delete Object Core?\n \
			\nAll manifestations of 
			
DeleteWarningText2 = you have selected will vanish \
			\nfrom all displays/objects visible to all users.  They will vanish \
			\nfrom their immediately related objects, but also \
			\nfrom more distantly related objects. \
			\n \
			\nTo instead remove only the particular manifestations you had \
			\nselected, click Cancel and then use Remove Manifestation.
			
DeleteErrorHasDescendantsText = Cannot delete this object. \
			\nFor safety, you may delete an object only if  it \
			\nhas no descendants.  You must empty this object first.
